// The For Loop
// The for loop has the following syntax:

// for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
//   // code block to be executed
// }
// Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

// Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

// Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.



for (    var i = 1;      i <= 5 ;        i++  )


    console.log(i);
